  ## Installation
  
  
 Make sure to have [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) downloaded.

- [**Express**](https://expressjs.com/) is the most widely used Node.js server framework, this allows us to create our own server-side APIs.


- [**Generate Unique ID**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generate-unique-id) is used to generate a unique random ID string.

Open a command prompt at the project's directory and run:

```
npm init -y  
npm install express 
npm install generate-unique-id
```
